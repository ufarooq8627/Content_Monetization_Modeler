# 📊 YouTube Ad Revenue Predictor – Content Monetization Model

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds an end-to-end **content monetization prediction system** using YouTube video analytics data. The goal is to **predict ad revenue** based on reach, engagement, viewer retention, content category, device type, and geography.

The project follows a **complete data science lifecycle**:
* Data cleaning & validation
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Feature engineering
* Model training & evaluation (Multiple Linear Regression models)
* Deployment through an interactive Streamlit App

---

## 🧠 Key Business Question

**What factors most strongly drive YouTube ad revenue, and how accurately can revenue be predicted from video performance metrics?**

---

## 🗂 Dataset

* Source: `youtube_ad_revenue_dataset.csv`
* Size: ~120,000 videos
* **Key features**:
  * Views, likes, comments (Reach and Engagement)
  * Watch time & video length (Retention)
  * Subscribers
  * Category, device, country
  * Ad revenue (USD) - Target Variable

---

## 🧹 Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering

1. **Cleaning**: Handled logical errors (negative values), missing data (imputed with medians), and duplicates.
2. **Log Transformation**: Applied to skewed numerical data (`log_views`, `log_subscribers`, `log_ad_revenue_usd`) to stabilize model variance. 
3. **Engineering**:
   * **Engagement Rate**: `(likes + comments) / views`
   * **Watch Time per View**: `watch_time_minutes / views` (Crucial indicator of content quality vs. simple clickbait).
   * Date parts derived from Upload Date (`year`, `month`, `dayofweek`).

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights

* **Watch time per view** shows the strongest relationship with ad revenue. Quality retention beats pure scale.
* Engagement rate has a limited standalone impact.
* Specific categories, devices, and countries show distributional shifts but are secondary to retention metrics.

## 🏆 Modeling Approach & Performance

* **Target Variable**: `log_ad_revenue_usd`
* Evaluated models strictly included linear approaches: **Linear Regression**, Ridge, Lasso, ElasticNet, and SGDRegressor.
* **Model Choice**: Standard **Linear Regression** performed the best, proving that our mathematically engineered features successfully modeled the business dynamics without requiring complex black-box algorithms.
* **Performance Metrics**: 
  * **R² Score**: ~0.9338
  * **RMSE**: ~$16.55
  * **MAE**: ~$8.94
* **Key Drivers**: 
  1. Watch time per view
  2. Log views
  3. Engagement rate

## 📌 Conclusion

Viewer retention (not just accidental views) is the **primary driver of monetization**. Optimizing **watch time per view** leads to more reliable and sustainable revenue growth than focusing solely on clickbait reach.
